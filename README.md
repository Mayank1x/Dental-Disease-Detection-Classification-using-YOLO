## üéØ Overview

This project implements a **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8)** object detection model to accurately detect and classify various dental pathologies directly from radiographic images. This system is designed to act as an initial screening tool, assisting dental professionals in rapid identification of potential problem areas.

### Key Diseases Detected:

* **Caries** (Tooth Decay)
* **Periapical Lesions** (Infections at the root tip)
* **Periodontitis** (Gum disease indicators)
* *(Customize this list based on your dataset/model)*

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Detection:** Utilizes the highly efficient YOLOv8 architecture for fast inference times.
* **Classification:** Provides bounding boxes and confidence scores for various disease classes.
* **Custom Training:** Includes all necessary files and instructions to re-train the model on a custom dataset.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts for handling image data and converting annotations to the required YOLO format.

## üñºÔ∏è Demo and Results
